## App Brainstorming
- Instagram
    - Explore page has content the user is interested in
    - Deleting/editing messages

- TikTok
    - Seeing who has viewed your profile
    - The *not interested* button to allow users to see less of a specific kind of video

- Discord 
    - Creating custom sound effects, gifs, and emojis
    - Deleting/editing messages

- Spotify
    - Creating group listening sessions
    - The *not interested* button to allow users to filter out songs/genres they don't like
    
**My Idea**:
    I would like to create an app revolving around working out and the interactions you can have while doing so. This app would have a leaderboard system between users and their friends, so they can compete when working out and stay motivated. There would also be an page like the explore page from Instagram where users can find content that relates to their fitness goals (bodybuilding, weightloss, general health, etc.).

## Notes

- It took some time to get used to using the XCode interface (some buttons and menus were hard to find)
- I had some trouble figuring out how to change the colors and fonts of the labels
